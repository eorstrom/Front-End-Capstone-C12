# Front-End-Capstone-C12
My Front End Capstone Project for NSS Cohort 12
Title: What's That Sound?

(As of 03/31/2016 - the app is still in development)

The purpose of this application is to allow a user to be able to track the gear (pedals, guitars, amplifiers, etc.) and their settings used on different songs they've recorded for reference later.

The user should be able to add their own song title, and add sections to the song. 

The user should then be able to add a piece of gear to a section of a song, adjust the settings, and then save the settings.
